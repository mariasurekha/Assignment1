(Due to some configurations issues, couldn't able to map the test methods with gherkin test steps)
Report - Testng xml file

Please refer to the feature file for test scenarios.

Attached functional test cases and defect list for more coverage.
From the defect list - we could identitfy the risk level and based on that we could make some changes, For example: "ID"should be always unique but where as in this application it accpets duplicate ID values, which will cause lot of confusion. So we need to make sure duplicate values are not allowed and need to follow proper format for each field values.

Attached Examples of API responses for referenece.
